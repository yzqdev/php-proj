## Introduce
`CatchAdmin` is a background management system based on secondary development of [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org). The `Laravel` community also has many excellent background management systems, such as `Nova`, an official product, which is of course charged, and `Filament` based on `Livewire` is free, and `Laravel Admin` has to be said. `CatchAdmin` still adopts the traditional front-end and back-end separation strategy, and the `Laravel` framework is only exported as `Api`. Coupling between management system modules is minimized. Each module has independent controllers, routes, models, and data tables. In terms of development, the influence between modules is minimized as much as possible, which reduces the difficulty of development. Based on `CatchAdmin`, systems such as `CMS`, `CRM`, `OA`, etc. can be developed. It also encapsulates many practical tools to enhance the development experience.
